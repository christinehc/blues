# ChemPyDentify

A Python package that converts NWChem output files into InChI and SMILES strings by estimating bond orders with the help of JANPA, an open source natural population analysis program.

ChemPyDentify is the result of a collaborative capstone project between students at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) and staff scientists at the [Pacific Northwest National Lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/) as a part of the [DIRECT (Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technologies) Training Program](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdirect/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).
